# 🎓 Student Record System (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple **Student Record System** created using Python.  
It showcases how to use common Python data structures such as **Lists**, **Tuples**, **Dictionaries**, **Sets**, and the **math module**.  
Users can add students, view records, analyze grades, and manage school clubs through a menu-driven interface.
